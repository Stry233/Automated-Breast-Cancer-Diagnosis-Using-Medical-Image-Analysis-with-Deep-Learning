# Automated-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Using-Medical-Image-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning
Breast cancer is a type of malignant tumor with the highest morbidity among women worldwide, which seriously endangers women's health. Besides, most breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). Like a malignant tumor, breast cancers affect more than 2.5 million people worldwide. In China, 6.6% of the 2,099,000 affected individuals in 2018 died, significantly exceeding the same prevalent cancers like prostate cancer (3.8%) and colon cancer (5.8%). Because of the incidence of breast cancer among women in the eastern and central regions of China ranks first, accurately identifying and categorizing IDC and proposing treatment plans become an essential clinical task. With the development of technology, it is possible to use a computer program to determine if tumor benign or malignant with tumor section images, which can effectively decrease the probability of misdiagnosis.  In this case, it is critical that develop a program to help doctors locating the tumor and start treatment as early as possible. What our goal is developing a computer program which can identify and label breast cancer cells in the tumor section image with high accuracy.
